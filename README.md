# kindle-web-tools
Turn Kindle Paperwhite e-reader into a development and production tool.

## Quick start for basic use
1. Copy `javascript.html` to your Kindle (not in subfolder for starters)
2. Open **Experimental Browser** (Three-vertical-dots menu > Experimental Browser).
3. In the address bar, type `file:///mnt/us/javascript.html?alert('Hi\x20there!')` (if you switch the Kindle off before closing the message, it will stay on screen! You can use it to leave messages.)
  - or type `file:///mnt/us/javascript.html?25*4+1` for a calculator
  - or type `file:///mnt/us/javascript.html?Date()` for a clock
4. bookmark it, type code, get a blank screen (that is proabbly a parse error), get frustrated, find solutions, enjoy, share

 _Amazon Kindle Paperwhite_ is a standalone portable computer that provides:
 * a great B/W touchscreen,
 * low computation power,
 * limited access to the internal memory.
 
 And also, it is primarily an e-reader. This project's target device is **Kindle Paperwhite 3**, (i. e. 7th Generation, year 2015) running the firmware version Kindle 5.12.3 (the most recent in 2020). [How to know which Kindle you have?](https://www.androidauthority.com/which-kindle-model-do-i-have-1073996)

This project contains resources and examples that I found useful to get the maximum of this device. The features generally rely on the "Experimental Web Browser". **No jailbreak, no root access nor any other modification that would breach any conditions of use or warranty is required.**

## Experimental Web Browser
Kindle incorporates a Web Browser that is not documented and not many resources about it were available in 2020. It is not a "modern" web-browser but has HTML5 capabilities and supports JavaScript (limited ES5), and it interprets XSLT using [libxslt v1.0.](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)

### Limitation of protocols and files
* When accessing a unsuported URL, an error message claims that ~~only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported~~.
* In reality, the main storage user storage space is available via URL file:///mnt/us
  - It gives you a browsable directory listing (including hidden files starting with a `.`)
    + Its webpage title is "OMG!" which is about what goes through your mind when you discover that you actually can view the content of your device.
* DataURI (`data:`) works only if generated by a link, **not** if entered in the address bar.
* So far only files with following extensions are rendered: TXT, HTML, HTM, JPG, JPEG, PNG, XML. In any upper/lower-case combination. The list might be incomplete. Otherwise, you get an error message claiming that ~~Only files with extension .AZW, .PRC, .MOBI or .TXT can be downloaded to your Kindle~~.
  - Sidenote: when you load or generate a TXT file, I could not find a way how to _download_ it. It always shows in the Browser and there is no "save as" or "download" option anywhere.

### Limitations of the access
* The _Experimental Web Browser_ does not have any access to the storage space
  * Cookies for file:/// protocol are stored only for the session

### Limitations of JS implementation
* Some constructors are missing (e.g. `new Blob()` would throw a rather absurd-sounding exception `'[object BlobConstructor]' is not a constructor`)
  - It includes all `Event` constructors, which means that event dispatching is an open issue (e.g. if we want to focus a text field)
* Touch or mouse down/up events are not triggered
* The constructor `new WebSocket` doesn't show any error; the newly created websocket immediately dies - calling `onclose()` without any return code nor reason nor `wasClean` flag.

### Other limitations
* Script's tag `src` attribute generated by `document.write` gets replaced by `about:blank`
```HTML
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eligrey/Blob.js/master/Blob.js"></script>
```
becomes
```HTML
<script src="about:blank"></script>
```
* hyperlinks are always underlined because the browser injects following `<style>` element:
```HTML
 <style type="text/css">a:-webkit-any-link{text-decoration: underline !important;}</style>
```
* `prompt()` dialog gets confirmed when space character is inserted (i.e. with on-screen keyboard), it supports text selection with press-and-drag
* address bar interactions with text selection and navigation:
  - press and drag works but need to stay in line!
    + touching upper border of the addressbar during selection makes selection till the begining of the URL
    + touching lower border takes you to the end of the URL


## Cool features
* **Screenshot**: press top-left and bottom-right corner at the same time. The screen flickers and stores the picture in the [root directory](#vocabulary) as `screenshot_2020_09_16T22_02_03+0800.png` with the structure `screenshot_yyyy_mm_ddTHH_MM_SS+ZZZZ.png` year, month, day, hour, minute, second, timeZone.
* A URL can be at least 2 million characters long (reached with an incremental JS approach but the device get slow)
  - Unfortunately it cannot be bookmarked. There seems to be a hard limit of overall size of the bookmarks higher than 33,000 characters.
* `~ds` **Screen always on** (will drain the battery!).
  - Into search bar of main screen or address bar of the web browser type: `~ds` it stands for "disable screensaver'
  - Useful when using as a message board, wall clock and continuously powered
  - Switch screen off once (long-press the bottom button > Screen Off) -- blank, no Kindle image
  - Re-enable screensaver by rebooting the device (Settings > Device Options > Restart)
* `;411` **Screen temperature** (and other info, firmware, time offset, ...)
* `;711` **List wifi networks** MAC, channel, AP MAC, available networks with encryptions, current IP, DNS
* [external link](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Touch_Hacking#Search_Bar_Shortcuts) to more search bar codes

## Weird stuff
* My screenshots were timestamped with `+0759` timezone (and I kept wondering why the clock on my Kindle is always a minute behind) until I fixed it by setting the time manually again. **For JavaScript, the Kindle's timezone is almost always UTC.** It means that inside JS, you can never deduce in which timezone you are! The offset is determined when the user sets the time and it seems only a hidden setting. (It would be possible to get the offset from screenshots though - as we can work with iframes, load a content of file:///mnt/us and parse it, find filenames matching the screenshot pattern and _voil√†_.)
* `Date()` shows the correct date with the right timezone offset however, using `new Date()` ruins it. To reset, Home button and starting Web browser does the trick and `Date()` works again. WEIRD
* I found no way to turn the backlight _completely_ off.
* Kindle does not provide Copy and Paste functionalities (an implementation is possible through `localstorage`)
